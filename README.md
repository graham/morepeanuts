# Suez: Easier auth for your your projects.

### The Goal
I was tired of re-writing google oauth flows, so I built Suez to be a simple, drop in proxy that sits between the world and your application. It handles Authentication and Authorization, is easy to modify, and fast enough for most small applications.

### Auth(entication) and Auth(orization)
While Suez is tailored for Google OAuth flows, it can be modified slightly to accomidate other OAuth flows
